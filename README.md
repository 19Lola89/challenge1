## Improved accessibility on given webpage

The purpose of this project was to improve the layout of the page so that it would be easier to navigate through the content using a wider variety of visual tools. 
I have built this project to ease the access to information. I have focused on special needs audience. 
The improved version has a better more sophisticated layout, clear design and informative tools such as image explanation, in case any of the images do not load or need to be anounced in written format. 
I have learnt basic HTML and CSS structures and ways which I can use those languages to shape and deploy content.
